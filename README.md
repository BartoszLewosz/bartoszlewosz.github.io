# Portfolio


[Have a look! ](https://bartoszlewosz.github.io)


## Description

This is my **Portfolio**. I made it during online course **WTF - WhatTheFrontend** for practice.

### What's behind?

To create this website I used *gulp-starter-pack*:

- HTML & CSS with scss 
- JavaScript
- GIT 
- gulp

I followed the BEM standards and wrote my code as **clean** as possible.
